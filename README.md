# PellePrinter
A Brazilian 3D printing solution using pellets to provide a more efficient and cost-effective alternative compared to the traditional filament systems, through direct extrusion of pellets in a professional, but affordable, FDM printing system.

# Background

This is a project that I have been silently sketching for about a year now (~2023). I'm currently developing this project as my Undergraduate thesis and expect to start uploading all additional information and project files soon. My goal from start was to achieve a fully functional and complete system, great for professional setups providing a much more versatile and cost-effective alternative over filament-based systems, while also being affordable enough for enthusiasts who makes a big portion of the 3D printing community. This affordable aspect resonates deeply with my brazillian context, where machines and technology in general are typically expensive, as it tends to be mostly usually imported, than produced locally.

Of course, IT IS hard to achieve anything like 'one-size fits all' solutions. That's why I have been cooking this idea for so long, and hence why I'm now developing it in my thesis (that may or may not end up being the entire project, or just a part of it. I'll have to see how it goes, not a lot of free time working 6~8h/day). I sure do recognise the challenge of developing a system that is both affordable and proffessionally-suited, as sure the most robust and feature-rich a system is the more expensive it tends to be. However, I also think, and have seen (and possible you too) that this logic tends to be overestimated and oversimplyfied, it's not a rule of thumb. I'm not saying that I think it will be easy to achieve an affordable professional-usage solution, but I aim to have an at least similar but better acessibility than a modern multi material and fast filament printer. So I'm all in to going full into this challenge to beat it.
